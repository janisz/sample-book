You can annotate the concept map with your current knowledge of each concept to keep track of your progress through the book.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add a single dot ($\bullet$) next to all concepts you've heard of.
	\item Add two dots ($\bullet\bullet$) next to concepts you think you know.
	\item Add three dots ($\bullet\!\bullet\!\bullet$) next to concepts you've used in exercises and problems.
\end{itemize}
By collecting some dots every week,
you'll be able to move through the material in no time at all.
