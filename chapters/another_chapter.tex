\chapter{Another chapter}

This is another chapter.\footnote{Footnotes are numbered on a per-chapter basis.} It also includes a little code fencing, mainly to test an edge case for the sake of the Softcover test suite:\footnote{The test suite uses the template files to stress-test the build system. In this case, there used to be a bug when math syntax appeared in a non-math context. Including the code fencing as above ensures that any regressions will cause the test suite to fail.}
