<p>Most math skills boil down to being able to manipulate and solve equations.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Solving an equation means finding the value of the unknown in the equation.</p>
<p>Check this  out:</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
	 x^2-4=45.
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">To solve the above equation is to answer
the question “What is <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span>?”<span class="intersentencespace"></span> More precisely, we want to find the number that can take the
place of <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span> in the equation so that the equality holds.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, we’re asking,</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
	  \text{``Which number times itself minus four gives 45?''}
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">That is quite a mouthful, don’t you think?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To remedy this verbosity, mathematicians often use specialized symbols to describe math operations.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The problem is that these specialized symbols can be very confusing.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Sometimes even the simplest math concepts are inaccessible if you don’t know what the symbols mean.</p>
<p>What are your feelings about math, dear reader?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Are you afraid of it?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Do you have anxiety attacks because you think it will be too difficult for you?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Chill!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Relax, my brothers and sisters.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There’s nothing to it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Nobody can magically guess the solution to an equation immediately.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To find the solution, you must break the problem into simpler steps.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Let’s walk through this one together.</p>
<p>To find <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span>, we can manipulate the original equation,
transforming it into a different equation (as true as the first) that looks like this:</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
	  x \; = \textrm{ only numbers.}
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">That’s what it means to <em>solve</em> an equation:
the equation is solved because the unknown is isolated on one side,
while the constants are grouped on the other side.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can type the numbers on the right-hand side into a calculator and obtain the numerical value of <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span>.</p>
<p>By the way, before we continue our discussion,
let it be noted: the equality symbol (<span class="inline_math">\( = \)</span>) means that all that is to the left of <span class="inline_math">\( = \)</span>
is equal to
all that is to the right of <span class="inline_math">\( = \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To keep this equality statement true,
<strong>for every change you apply to the left side of the equation,
you must apply the same change to the right side of the equation</strong>.</p>
<p>To find <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span>,
we need to manipulate the original equation into its final form,
simplifying it step by step until it can’t be simplified any further.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The only requirement is that the manipulations we make transform one true equation into another true equation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this example,
the first simplifying step is to add the number four to both sides of the equation:</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
	 	x^2-4  \; + 4  	=	45    \; + 4, 	    \\
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">which simplifies to</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
		x^2 	 		=	49.
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">Now the expression looks simpler, yes?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> How did I know to perform this operation?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> I wanted to “undo” the effects of the operation <span class="inline_math">\( -4 \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We undo an operation by applying its <em>inverse</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the case where the operation is the subtraction of some amount,
the inverse operation is the addition of the same amount.</p>
<p>We’re getting closer to our goal of <em>isolating</em> <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span> on one side of the equation, leaving only numbers on the other side.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The next step is to undo the square <span class="inline_math">\( x^2 \)</span> operation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The inverse operation of squaring a number <span class="inline_math">\( x^2 \)</span> is to take its square root <span class="inline_math">\( \sqrt{\phantom{a}\; } \)</span>,
so that’s what we’ll do next.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We obtain</p>
<div class="equation">\[  
	   \sqrt{x^2} 		= 	\sqrt{49}.
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">Notice how we applied the square root to both sides of the equation?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If we don’t apply the same operation to both sides, we’ll break the equality!</p>
<p>The equation <span class="inline_math">\( \sqrt{x^2}= \sqrt{49} \)</span> simplifies to</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
	 	|x|	= 	7.
	  \]
</div><p class="noindent">What’s up with the vertical bars around <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span>?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The notation <span class="inline_math">\( |x| \)</span> stands for the <em>absolute value</em> of <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span>, which is the same as <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span> except we ignore the sign that indicates whether <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span> is positive or negative.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example <span class="inline_math">\( |5|=5 \)</span> and <span class="inline_math">\( |-5|=5 \)</span>, too.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The equation <span class="inline_math">\( |x|=7 \)</span> indicates that both <span class="inline_math">\( x=7 \)</span> and <span class="inline_math">\( x=-7 \)</span> satisfy the equation <span class="inline_math">\( x^2 = 49 \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Seven squared is 49, <span class="inline_math">\( 7^2=49 \)</span>, and negative seven squared is also 49, <span class="inline_math">\( (-7)^2 = 49 \)</span>,
because the two negative signs cancel each other out.</p>
<p>The final solutions to the equation <span class="inline_math">\( x^2-4=45 \)</span> are</p>
<div class="equation">\[ 
	 x  = 7 \qquad \textrm{and} \qquad   x=  - 7.
	 \]
</div><p class="noindent">Yes, there are <em>two</em> possible answers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can check that both of the above values of <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span> satisfy the initial equation <span class="inline_math">\( x^2-4=45 \)</span>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt">If you are comfortable with all the notions of high school math

then this chapter is for you!<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the following sections we will review all the essential concepts from
high school math that you will need to power through the rest of this book.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, let me tell you about the different kinds of numbers.</p>
</div><div id="sec-numbers" data-tralics-id="cid3" class="section" data-number="1.2"><h2><a href="01_math_fundamentals_fragment.html#sec-numbers" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.2 </span>Numbers</a></h2>
<p>In the beginning, we must define the main players in the world of math: numbers.</p>
<div id="numbers-definitions" data-tralics-id="uid8" class="subsection" data-number="1.2.1"><h3><a href="#numbers-definitions" class="heading">Definitions</a></h3>
<p>Numbers are the basic objects we use to count, measure, quantify, and calculate things.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Mathematicians like to classify the different kinds of number-like objects into categories called <em>sets</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The natural numbers: <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7, \ldots \, \} \)</span>
</li>
<li>The integers: <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{Z} = \{\ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 , \ldots  \, \} \)</span>
</li>
<li>The rational numbers: <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{Q} = \{\frac{5}{3}, \frac{22}{7}, 1.5, 0.125,  -7, \, \ldots \, \} \)</span>
</li>
<li>The real numbers: <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{R} = \{-1,0,1, \sqrt{2}, e,\pi, \;  4.94\ldots, \; \ldots \, \} \)</span>
</li>
<li>The complex numbers: <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{C} = \{ -1, 0, 1, i,  1+i, 2+3i,  \ldots \, \} \)</span>
</li></ul>
<p>These categories of numbers should be somewhat familiar to you.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Think of them as neat classification labels for everything that you would normally call a number.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each group in the above list is a <em>set</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> A set is a collection of items of the same kind.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each collection has a name and a precise definition for which items belong in that collection.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Note also that each of the sets in the list contains all the sets above it, as illustrated in <a href="01_math_fundamentals_fragment.html#fig-nested_sets" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For now, we don’t need to go into the details of sets and set notation,
but we do need to be aware of the different sets of numbers.</p>
<div class="center figure" id="fig-nested_sets" data-tralics-id="uid14" data-number="1.2"><span class="graphics"><img src="images/figures/math/nested_sets.png" alt="nested_sets" style="width:100%;" /></span>
<div class="caption"><span class="header">Figure 1.2: </span><span class="description">An illustration of the nested containment structure of the different number sets.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The set of natural numbers is contained in the set of integers,
which in turn is contained in the set of rational numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The set of rational numbers is contained in the set of real numbers,
which is contained in the set of complex numbers.
</span></div></div>
<p class="noindent">Why do we need so many different sets of numbers?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Each set of numbers is associated with more and more advanced mathematical problems.</p>
<p>The simplest numbers are the natural numbers <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{N} \)</span>,
which are sufficient for all your math needs if all you’re going to do is <em>count</em> things.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> How many goats?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Five goats here and six goats there so the total is 11 goats.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The sum of any two natural numbers is also a natural number.</p>
<p>As soon as you start using <em>subtraction</em> (the inverse operation of addition),
you start running into negative numbers,
which are numbers outside the set of natural numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If the only mathematical operations you will ever use are <em>addition</em> and <em>subtraction</em>,
then the set of integers <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{Z} = \{ \ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots \} \)</span> will be sufficient.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Think about it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Any integer plus or minus any other integer is still an integer.</p>
<p>You can do a lot of interesting math with integers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There is an entire field in math called <em>number theory</em> that deals with integers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, to restrict yourself solely to integers is somewhat limiting—a rotisserie
menu that offers <span class="inline_math">\( \frac{1}{2} \)</span> of a chicken would be totally confusing.</p>
<p>If you want to use division in your mathematical calculations, you’ll need the rationals <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{Q} \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The set of rational numbers corresponds to all numbers that can be expressed as <em>fractions</em> of the form <span class="inline_math">\( \frac{m}{n} \)</span> where <span class="inline_math">\( m \)</span> and <span class="inline_math">\( n \)</span> are integers, and <span class="inline_math">\( n \neq 0 \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers, and the result will always be a rational number.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, even the rationals are not enough for all of math!</p>
<p>In geometry, we can obtain <em>irrational</em> quantities like <span class="inline_math">\( \sqrt{2} \)</span> (the diagonal of a square with side 1)
and <span class="inline_math">\( \pi \)</span> (the ratio between a circle’s circumference and its diameter).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> There are no integers <span class="inline_math">\( x \)</span> and <span class="inline_math">\( y \)</span> such that <span class="inline_math">\( \sqrt{2}=\frac{x}{y} \)</span>,
therefore we say that <span class="inline_math">\( \sqrt{2} \)</span> is <em>irrational</em> (not in the set <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{Q} \)</span>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> An irrational number has an infinitely long decimal expansion that doesn’t repeat.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For example, <span class="inline_math">\( \pi = 3.141592653589793\ldots \)</span> where the dots indicate
that the decimal expansion of <span class="inline_math">\( \pi \)</span> continues all the way to infinity.</p>
<p>Combining the irrational numbers with the rationals gives us all the useful numbers,
which we call the set of real numbers <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{R} \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The set <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{R} \)</span> contains the integers,
the rational numbers <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{Q} \)</span>,
as well as irrational numbers like <span class="inline_math">\( \sqrt{2}=1.4142135\ldots \)</span>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> By using the reals you can compute pretty much anything you want.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> From here on in the text, when I say <em>number</em>,
I mean an element of the set of real numbers <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{R} \)</span>.</p>
<p>The only thing you can’t do with the reals is to take the square root of a negative number—you need the complex numbers <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{C} \)</span> for that.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> We defer the discussion on <span class="inline_math">\( \mathbb{C} \)</span> until the end of <a href="03_vectors_fragment.html#chapter-vectors" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">3</span></a>.</p>
