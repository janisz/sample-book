\section{Vectors}
\label{sec:vectors}

	Vectors are extremely useful in all areas of life.
	In physics, for example, we use a vector to describe the velocity of an object.
	It is not sufficient to say that the speed of a tennis ball is 200 kilometres per hour:
	we must also specify the direction in which the ball is moving.
	Both of the two velocities 
	\[
	 \vec{v}_1 = (200,0) 
	 \qquad \textrm{and}
	 \qquad \vec{v}_2=(0,200)
	\]
	describe motion at the speed of $200$ kilometres per hour;
	but since one velocity points along the $x$-axis, and the other points along the $y$-axis,
	they are \emph{completely} different velocities. 
	The velocity vector contains information about the object's speed \emph{and} its direction.
	The direction makes a big difference.
	If it turns out the tennis ball is hurtling toward you, you'd better get out of the way!

	The main idea in this chapter is that \textbf{vectors are not the same as numbers}.
	We'll start by defining what vectors are.
	Then we'll describe all the mathematical operations we can perform with vectors,
	which include
		vector addition $\vec{u}+\vec{v}$, 
		vector subtraction $\vec{u}-\vec{v}$,
		vector scaling $\alpha\vec{v}$,
		and other operations.


	\subsection{Definitions}
	\label{vectors:definitions}

		A two-dimensional vector $\vec{v}$ corresponds to a \emph{pair of numbers}:
		\[
			\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y),
		\]
		where $v_x$ is the \emph{$x$-component} of the vector and $v_y$ is its \emph{$y$-component}.					\index{components}
		We denote the set of two-dimensional vectors as $\mathbb{R}^2$,
		since the components of a two-dimensional vector are specified by two real numbers.
		We'll use the mathematical shorthand $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ to define a two-dimensional vector $\vec{v}$.
		Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be represented as arrows in the Cartesian plane.
		See the vector $\vec{v}=(3,2)$ illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:vector_components}.

		We can also define three-dimensional vectors like the vector $\vec{v} = (v_x, v_y, v_z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$,
		which has three components.
		A three-dimensional coordinate system is similar to the Cartesian coordinate system you're familiar with,
		and includes the additional $z$-axis that measures the height above the plane.
		In fact,
		there's no limit to the number of dimensions for vectors.
		We can define vectors in an $n$-dimensional space:								\index{dimension}
		$\vec{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$.
		For the sake of simplicity,
		we'll define all the vector operation formulas using two-dimensional vectors.
		Unless otherwise indicated in the text,
		all the formulas we give for two-dimensional vectors $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^2$
		also apply to $n$-dimensional vectors $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.


		\subsubsection{Vector operations}

			Consider two vectors,
			$\vec{u}=(u_x,u_y) $ and $\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y)$,
			and assume that $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary constant. 
			The following operations are defined for these vectors:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item 	\textbf{Addition:}	$\vec{u} + \vec{v} = (u_x+v_x,\, u_y+v_y)$
				\item 	\textbf{Subtraction:}	$\vec{u} - \vec{v} = (u_x-v_x,\, u_y-v_y)$
				\item 	\textbf{Scaling:}		$\alpha \vec{u} = (\alpha u_x,\, \alpha u_y)$
				\item 	\textbf{Dot product:}	$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}  = u_xv_x+u_yv_y$								\index{dot product}
				\item 	\textbf{Length:}		$\|\vec{u}\| = \sqrt{\vec{u}\cdot\vec{u}} = \sqrt{u_x^2+u_y^2}$.
						The vector's length is also called the \emph{norm} of the vector.
						We sometimes use the letter $u$ to denote the length of the vector $\vec{u}$.
			\end{itemize}

			\noindent
			Note there is no vector division operation.

			For vectors in a three-dimensional space $\vec{u}=(u_x,u_y,u_z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$
			and $\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$,
			we can also define the \textbf{cross product} operation												\index{cross product}
			$\vec{u} \times \vec{v} = (u_yv_z-u_zv_y,\; u_zv_x-u_xv_z,\; u_xv_y-u_yv_x)$.
			The dot product and the cross product are new operations that you probably haven't seen before.


		\subsubsection{Vector representations}

			We'll use three equivalent ways to denote vectors in two dimensions:
			\begin{itemize}
			    \item   	$\vec{v} =(v_x, v_y)$: component notation.
					The vector is written as a pair of numbers called the \emph{components} or \emph{coordinates} of the vector.	\index{coordinates}
			    \item 	$\vec{v} =v_x\hat{\imath}+ v_y\hat{\jmath}$: unit vector notation.
					The vector is expressed as a combination of the unit vectors
					$\hat{\imath} = (1,0)$ and $ \hat{\jmath} = (0,1)$.
			    \item   	$\vec{v}=\|\vec{v}\|\angle \theta$: length-and-direction notation (polar coordinates).
					The vector is expressed in terms of its \emph{length} $\|\vec{v}\|$
					and the angle $\theta$ that the vector makes with the $x$-axis.
			\end{itemize}

			\begin{figure}[htb]
				\centering
				\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/vectors/vector_components_annotated.pdf}
				\vspace{-2mm}
				\caption{The vector $\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y) = v_x\hat{\imath}+ v_y\hat{\jmath} = \|\vec{v}\|\angle \theta$.}
				\label{fig:vector_components_annotated}
			\end{figure}

			\noindent
			We use the component notation for doing vector algebra calculations since it is most compact.
			The unit vector notation shows explicitly that the vector $\vec{v}$ corresponds to the sum of
			$v_x\hat{\imath}$ (a displacement of $v_x$ steps in the direction of the $x$-axis)
			and $v_y\hat{\jmath}$ (a displacement of $v_y$ steps in the direction of the $y$-axis).
			The length-and-direction notation describes the vector $\vec{v}$
			as a displacement of $\|\vec{v}\|$ steps in the direction of the angle $\theta$.
			We'll use all three ways of denoting vectors throughout the rest of the book,
			and we'll learn how to convert between them.
